Just to control electroic application

yet,I just want to control some application such light&&Relay in my house,so I designed some board by DXP,and write such code to run,oh..
forgot to tell you that this code run on STM32 ,those board commucate by 433MHz(SI4463 modules).

recently I am working on smart-device which named "Gokit",by using this device,I can use Android APP to send command and then control the 
application.
